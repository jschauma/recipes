Ingredients

2 large egg yolks, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cup(s) half-and-half
8 ounce(s) (about 7 slices) Niman Ranch Applewood Smoked Bacon
1 cup(s) chopped onions
2 tablespoon(s) minced garlic
1/2 cup(s) grated Pecorino Romano cheese
1/2 cup(s) chopped parsley
1 teaspoon(s) salt
1/2 teaspoon(s) fresh-ground black pepper
1 pound(s) perciatelli pasta, cooked and kept warm

Directions

Make the carbonara sauce: Lightly beat the yolks and half-and-half in a
medium bowl and set aside. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high
heat until crisp. Reserve 1 tablespoon of bacon fat and cook the onions
over medium heat until translucent -- about 5 minutes. Add garlic and
continue to cook for 2 more minutes. Reduce heat to low and add the egg
mixture and the bacon. Stirring constantly, cook until the sauce begins to
thicken slightly -- about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup of the cheese, plus
the parsley, salt, and pepper, and remove from heat.

Pour the sauce over the cooked pasta, toss until well-coated, and sprinkle
with the remaining cheese. Serve immediately.
