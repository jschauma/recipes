Spaetzle With Kielbasa and Caramelized Onions
1 pound smoked kielbasa, cut into 3/4-inch chunks
1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 large red onion, halved and thinly sliced
1 large thyme sprig
Kosher salt
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
3/4 cup whole milk
1/2 pound Emmentaler cheese, grated (2 cups)
1/2 teaspoon black pepper.

1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, lightly brown the kielbasa
until golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Melt the butter in the
skillet. Stir in the onion and thyme, and stir briefly to coat the onion
with butter. Cook onion, without stirring, until dark brown, about 5
minutes. Add a pinch of salt and cook on low heat until very soft and
caramelized, 20 to 30 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons water and scrape up
any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Transfer onion to a bowl.

2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In a large bowl, combine
the flour, 1 teaspoon salt and the nutmeg. In a separate bowl, whisk
together the eggs and milk. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture
and stir well. The batter should be fairly wet, with a consistency
slightly thicker than pancake batter.

3. Spread a clean dish towel flat on a work surface adjacent to the stove.
Working over the pot of boiling water, press dough through a spaetzle
maker or use a rubber spatula to push it through a colander with holes at
least 1/4-inch wide. Drop dough into the water. When dumplings rise to the
surface, use a slotted spoon to transfer to the towel.

4. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Toss the spaetzle and kielbasa in the
bowl with the onions, and add 1 1/2 cups cheese and the pepper. Spread
into a 2-quart gratin dish. Sprinkle the top of the casserole with the
remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake until golden and bubbling, 25 to 30
minutes.
