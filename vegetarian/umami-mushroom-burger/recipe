Ingredients

    2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more for drizzling
    2 shallots, chopped
    16 ounces mushrooms, mix of shiitake + portobello, de-stemmed and diced
    2 tablespoons tamari
    ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
    1 tablespoon mirin, or ½ teaspoon maple syrup
    2 garlic cloves, minced
    ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
    2 teaspoons sriracha, more if desired
    ½ cup crushed walnuts
    ¼ cup ground flaxseed
    2 cups cooked short-grain brown rice, freshly cooked so that it's sticky
    1 cup panko bread crumbs, divided
    vegan worcestershire sauce, for brushing
    nonstick cooking spray, for grilling
    buns & desired burger fixings
    sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Instructions

Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and
sauté until soft, 1 minute. Add the mushrooms, a generous pinch of salt, and
sauté until soft and browned, 6 to 9 minutes, turning down the heat slightly,
as needed.

Stir in the tamari, vinegar, and mirin. Stir, reduce the heat, then add the
garlic, and smoked paprika, and sriracha. Remove the pan from the heat and let
cool slightly.

In a food processor, combine the sautéed mushrooms, walnuts, flaxseed, brown
rice, and ½ cup of the panko. Pulse until well combined.

Transfer to a bowl and stir in the remaining panko.

Form into 8 slider-sized patties or 6 burger-sized patties.

Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Spray the grill with nonstick cooking
spray and drizzle or brush the patties with olive oil. Grill for 4 to 5 minutes
per side, or until char marks form. Remove from the grill, brush with
Worcestershire sauce, and serve with desired fixings.
