6 tablespoons grated pecorino Romano
2 large tomatoes (about 1 pound), cored and roughly chopped
1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) plain sheep's -milk or regular yogurt
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, more for serving
12 basil leaves, roughly chopped, more for serving
2 large garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
2 scallions (white and light green parts), roughly chopped
2 ice cubes
1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons red wine vinegar, more to taste

Pinch cayenne pepper

Ground black pepper to taste.

1. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Spread 2 tablespoons
cheese into a thin layer in skillet; let melt and brown on bottom, about
30 seconds to one minute. Use a spatula to flip cheese; let cook until
evenly browned on both sides, about a minute more. Transfer fried cheese
to a paper-towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining cheese, working 2
tablespoons at a time. Break fried cheese into large pieces.

2. To make soup, place tomatoes, yogurt, olive oil, basil, garlic,
scallions, ice cubes, salt, vinegar, cayenne and black pepper in a
blender. Pur√©e until smooth. Taste and add more salt and vinegar, if
necessary. Pour into small bowls and garnish with pieces of fried cheese
and chopped basil. Drizzle soup liberally with olive oil.


Serve with basil/prosciutto crostini:

Cut french bread in thin slices and brush with Olive Oil on both sides.
Bake in oven until golden.
Place a slice of prosciutto and a few basil leaves on each.
