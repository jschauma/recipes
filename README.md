Recipes
=======

This repository contains a number of recipes that I like to make.  The
reason to store them here on GitHub is that I often find recipes on the
internet, but unfortunately websites are often short-lived.  I also
sometimes vary the recipes or come up with my own changes, and keeping a
folder of printed recipes has proven not to be very practical any more.

In addition, the idea of Open Source is often explained by using cooking
recipes as examples: people take a recipe, make changes, share it with
their friends and family and so on.  So hey, let's d that!

(Just don't issue pull requests for that Neiman-Marcus cookie recipe...)
