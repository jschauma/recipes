This cake has been the traditional birthday cake in my family for a long
time.  Powdered hazelnuts used to be be hard to find; use a food processor
to finely pulverize chopped hazelnuts.  Some of the amounts below are
given in metric measurements, some aren't; this reflects the admittedly
un-german and inaccurate method of cooking by estimation rather than
precise conversion.  The added chocolate chips are a result of natural
recipe evolution from chef to chef.

Ingredients:

6 eggs, separated
350g sugar
400g chopped hazelnuts
400g carrots
100g sifted flour
1.5 teaspoons baking powder
some vanilla extract
about one cup chocolate chips (optional)

Preparation:

Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.

Grease a Bundt-Cake pan and dust with flour, tapping out excess flour.

Finely pulverize chopped hazelnuts in a food processor.
Peel and grate carrots.  Combine carrots and hazelnuts with flour,
baking powder, vanilla extract, sugar and egg yolks.  Add chocolate chips, if
using.

Beat egg-whites to stiff peaks and gently fold into batter.

Transfer batter into cake pan.

Bake for approximately 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted in the center
comes out clean.  Let cool, then turn out onto a rack.  Glaze with your favorite chocolate
frosting, chocolate icing or chocolate glaze.
