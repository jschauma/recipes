Sponge:

3.5 cups flour
1.75 cup room temperature water
3.125 tsp. dry yeast

Dough:

5.125 cups flour
1.5 cup lukewarm water
3.124 tsp. dry yeast
1.5 tbsp. honey
1.5 tbsp. Kosher salt

Instructions


The night before making the rolls, start by preparing the pre-dough aka sponge. Mix flour, water, and yeast in a small bowl, cover it airtight, and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.


The next morning, continue with the main dough. Dissolve yeast and honey in lukewarm water in a stand mixer bowl.

Add the flour, salt, and sponge to the bowl. Then knead all the ingredients for about 5 minutes on low speed, and then for 5 minutes on medium-high speed to form a smooth, soft dough. The dough should still be slightly sticky.

Cover the bowl airtight and let the dough rise for about 1 – 1 ½ hours.

After the resting period, turn the dough out onto a floured work surface, knead it well, and shape it into 10 equal-sized oval rolls.

Place the rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let them rest for about 30 minutes.

Gently brush the rolls with water and make a lengthwise cut about ½ inch deep using a sharp knife or a lame.

Add about ½ cup water to the oven right before baking to create steam. This will ensure a great texture for the rolls.

Bake the rolls at 425°F in a preheated oven for about 20 minutes until golden brown.
Let the rolls cool on a rack and enjoy.
