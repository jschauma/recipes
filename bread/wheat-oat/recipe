1 3/4 - 2 1/4 cups	all-purpose flour
1/3  cup 		rolled oats
1   package 		active dry yeast
1   cup 		warm water (120 degrees F. to 130 degrees F.)
2   tablespoons		honey or maple-flavored syrup
2/3  cup 		whole wheat flour
1/2  teaspoon 		salt

some cooking oil, skim milk

In a medium mixing bowl combine 1-1/4 cups of the all-purpose flour, the
1/3 cup oats, the yeast, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add the water, honey or
syrup, and oil. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds,
scraping bowl constantly. Beat on high speed 3 minutes. Stir in whole
wheat flour and as much of the remaining all-purpose flour as you can.

On a lightly floured surface knead in enough remaining all-purpose flour
to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8
minutes total). Shape into a ball. Spray a bowl with nonstick coating.
Place dough in bowl; turn once. Cover; let rise in a warm place until
double in size (50 to 60 minutes). Punch down. Turn out onto a lightly
floured surface. Cover; let rest 10 minutes.

Spray an 8x4x2-inch loaf pan with nonstick coating. Shape dough into loaf;
place in pan. Cover; let rise until nearly double (30 to 45 minutes).
Brush with milk; sprinkle lightly with additional oats.

Bake in a 375 degree F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until bread sounds
hollow when lightly tapped. Remove from pan. Cool on wire rack.
