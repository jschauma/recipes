Starter

3/4 cup (113g) cool water
1 cup (120g) bread flour
1/8 teaspoon instant yeast


Dough

All of the starter
3 1/2 cups (418g) All-Purpose Flour
1 cup (227g) lukewarm water
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon instant yeast


Mix the starter ingredients till smooth, cover, and
let rest at room temperature overnight.

Next day, mix the starter with the remaining
ingredients, kneading until the dough is nice and
springy, but not totally smooth. Place the dough in a
lightly greased bowl, cover, and let it rise for 3
hours, gently deflating it and turning it over after 1
hour, and again after 2 hours.

Divide the dough in half, and shape each half into a
rough oval. Wait 15 minutes, then fold each oval
lengthwise, sealing the edge, and use cupped fingers
to gently roll each piece into a long (about 17") log.

Place the loaves onto a lightly greased or
parchment-lined pan, cover, and let them rise until
they're puffy but not doubled, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven
to 425Â°F.

VERY gently, use a sharp knife or razor blade to
make three diagonal 1/3"-deep slashes in each loaf.
Mist the loaves heavily with warm water (or add steam
to your oven; see "tips," below).


Bake the baguettes for 22 to 28 minutes, until
they're golden brown. Take the baguettes off the pan
and place them right on the oven rack. Turn off the
oven, crack the door open about 2", and let the
baguettes cool completely in the oven.
