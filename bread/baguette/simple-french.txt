5 cups Flour
1 tbsp. Dry Active Yeast
2 tsp. Salt
2 cups Warm Water
Oil for bowl

How to make it:

1. In a bowl, mix together the flour and the salt.
2. In another bowl, combine yeast, warm water, and half of the flour/salt
mixture. Using your hands, mix until it forms a dough. Then, cover with a
dish cloth and let sit at room temperature for 3 hours. It should triple
in size.
3. Gently incorporate the rest of the flour/salt, using your hands.
4. Place on a lightly floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes. It
should be supple and elastic when you stop kneading.
5. Lightly oil a bowl. Place dough in bowl. Cover with a dish towel. Let
sit for 1 hour. It should double in size.
6. Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Knead again. Then cut dough into 3 parts and
form each part into a long baguette. Place on a baking sheet. Let sit for
at least 20 minutes.
7. Place a bowl of water in the oven. Bake baguettes for about 25 minutes
(maybe less). Remove the bowl of water after 15 minutes of baking.
