makes two loaves

1 lb whole wheat flour
12 oz hot water
8 ounces bread or all-purpose flour
1 5 oz can evaporated milk
1/3 cup honey
2 teaspoons salt
3 teaspoons instant yeast an additional
1/2-1 cup flour, as necessary, to achieve the desired consistency

Mix the hot water and whole wheat flour together in a bowl. Cover the bowl
with plastic and set aside until around room temperature, at least 1 hour.

Add the milk, honey, salt, yeast, and bread flour to the original mixture
and mix until well combined. Add additional flour and knead by hand or in
a stand mixer until a tacky but not completely sticky dough is formed.

Place the ball of dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and
set aside to rise for 60 to 90 minutes.

Divide the dough in two and shape the loaves. Place the loaves in greased
bread pans, cover the pans loosely with plastic (I put them in a plastic
bag), and set aside to rise again for 90 minutes.

During the final 30 minutes of rising, preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
Place the pans into the oven and immediately reduce the oven temperature
to 375 degrees. Bake for approximately 45 to 55 minutes, rotating the pans
once so that they brown evenly, until the internal temperature of the
loaves is around 190 degrees and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when
tapped.
