8 ounces sturdy tortilla chips
1 can (15 ounces) pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1 packed cup (4 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese
1 packed cup (4 ounces) shredded Monterey Jack cheese, or additional cheddar
1 medium red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 green jalapeno
avocado
1/3 cup chopped green onions
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
red onion
1/2 sweet corn


Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking
sheet with parchment paper. Place handfuls of chips on
the baking sheet and distribute evenly, minimizing the
gaps between chips. Set aside.

Sprinkle the prepared pan of chips generously and
evenly with the beans, followed by the shredded
cheese, bell pepper, crumbled feta and pickled
jalapeños (use more if you really love jalapeños,
less if you don't). Bake until the cheese is
melted and bubbling, about 9 to 13 minutes. Remove the
nachos from the oven and set aside.

While the nachos are baking, make the avocado sauce
and prepare the garnishes.

Once the nachos are out of the oven, drizzle avocado
sauce on top as shown -- any extra can be served on
the side. (If using guacamole instead, dollop the
guacamole over the nachos like polka dots.) Sprinkle
the nachos with chopped green onion, radish and
cilantro. Serve immediately, with salsa on the side.
