1 1/2 to 2 pounds beef tenderloin (filet mignon), trimmed of excess fat
  and cut into 1-inch cubes
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
2 tablespoons sugar
Salt and pepper
5 tablespoons neutral oil, like corn or canola
1/4 cup rice-wine vinegar
1/4 cup rice or white wine
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 red onion, peeled and sliced thin
3 scallions, trimmed and cut in 1-inch lengths
2 tablespoons butter
2 bunches watercress, washed and dried, or 1 head red leaf lettuce, washed,
  dried and separated into leaves
2 limes, cut into wedges


1.  Marinate meat with garlic, half the sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4
teaspoon pepper and 1 tablespoon oil for about 2 hours. (Refrigerate if
your kitchen is very warm.) Meanwhile, combine vinegar, remaining sugar,
wine, soy sauce and fish sauce. Taste, and add salt and pepper if
necessary. Mix about 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in a small
bowl.

2.  Divide the meat into 2 portions, and do the same with the onion and
scallions. Put a wok or a large skillet over maximum heat, and add about 2
tablespoons oil. When the oil smokes, add the meat in one layer. Let it
sit until a brown crust forms, and turn to brown the other side. Browning
should take less than 5 minutes. Add half the onion and half the
scallions, and cook, stirring, about 30 seconds. Add about half the
vinegar mixture, and shake pan to release the beef, stirring if necessary.
Add half the butter, and shake pan until butter melts. Remove meat, and
repeat.

3.  Serve beef over watercress or lettuce leaves, passing salt and pepper
mixture and lime wedges at the table.
