    8 chicken thighs
    2 tablespoons flour
    1 tablespoon kosher salt
    1 tablespoon ground black pepper
    2 tablespoons unsalted butter
    12 to 15 whole medium shallots, peeled
    2 cups white wine
    2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
    2 sprigs tarragon
    2 cups cherry tomatoes, cut in half.

Preparation

1. Rinse chicken thighs in water, and pat them very dry with paper towels.
Sprinkle over them the flour, salt and pepper.

2. Melt the butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or skillet set over
medium-high heat. When the butter foams, cook the chicken, in batches if
necessary, until well browned and crisp on all sides. Set aside.

3. Add the whole shallots to the pot and saut√© them in the butter and
chicken fat until they begin to soften and caramelize, approximately 10 to
12 minutes. Add the wine to deglaze the pot, stir with a large spoon, then
add the mustard and tarragon, then the chicken thighs. Cover the pot, turn
the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.

4. Remove the lid, and allow the sauce to reduce and thicken, 15 to 20
minutes.

5. Add the cherry tomatoes to the pot, stir lightly to combine and serve
immediately.
