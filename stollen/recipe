This is from an old German cookbook; the list of ingredients and
measurements are ballpark numbers.

500g Mehl
some baking powder
some vanilla
some rum
some kardamom
some nutmeg
marzipan
2 Eier
125g Butter
250g Quark
125g Korinthen
125 - 250g Rosinen

Basically: just mix everything and form a loaf.
Bake for an hour or so at some reasonable baking temperature.  Let's say
375F.
